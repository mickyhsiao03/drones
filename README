This is Team Bupkis' Final Project

The proper order to execute the files is to run main.py, which will open StanfordKarel. 
The included 7x7 or 40x40 maps are the ones we tested Karel on in class.

Following this, the Command.txt file will be created.

Connect your laptop to the tello drone's network before the following.
The command "py app.py -f Command.txt" will pipe the commands from the txt file to the drone.

That same command but with the testflight.txt file will make the drone fly in a small square.
Helpful to troubleshoot sources of drifting.
